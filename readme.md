# App to detect real file extension

1. Program support .jpg, .gif and .pdf file extensions.
2. I have no idea how to cope with .txt file - .txt file without any content is fully empty - 
there are any magic numbers inside.
3. Program is able to say if the content of file is fitting to the file extension, 
if it does not program say what is real file extension.
4. If we want to check an unsupported file extension or a file is not exists program throw an exception.
5. Main method include some preprepared examples to examine app working.
